        Connect to SQLite database.

    Table Creation and Definition
        If tables "student", "lesson", and "student_lesson" do not exist,
            create them with the specified attributes and relationships.

    Query Definitions

b. Input Collection and Validation

    Prompt User for Student Details
        Student ID, first name, last name, age, grade, enrollment date, and enrolled lessons.
    Validation
        Validate student ID: ensure it is unique and a positive integer.
        Validate labels (first name, last name, grade, lessons): ensure they are correctly formatted and contain valid characters.
        Validate age: ensure it is a number between 5 and 35.
        Validate enrollment date: ensure it matches the format (dd-MM-YYYY).
        Validate lesson details: ensure the student is enrolled in at least one lesson.

c. Data Insertion
