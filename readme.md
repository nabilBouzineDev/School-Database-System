## Problem Definition

> **_Problem Definition_**: School Management System for Lessons and Student Management

> **_Current Situation_**:
Schools currently manage lessons and student enrollment manually, using paper-based systems or spreadsheets. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

> **_Desired Situation_**:
The school needs a database based system to manage lessons and student enrollment efficiently. The system should allow users to view student information, manage enrolled lessons, add, update, and delete student records, and view student information.
